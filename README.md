### Schema Converter
Converts JSON schemas into YAML 

## Getting Started
Run `npm install` to install dependencies
Run `npm start` to start the application

## How it works
This application reads `json` files within the `originals` directory, parses the contents, and writes out `yaml` into a generated directory called `output`
